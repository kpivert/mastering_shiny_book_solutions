:::question
Draw the reactive graph for the following server functions:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
server1 <- function(input, output, session) {
  c <- reactive(input$a + input$b)
  e <- reactive(c() + input$d)
  output$f <- renderText(e())
}
```
:::

- inputs: `input$a`, `input$b`, and `input$d`
- reactives: `c()` and `e()`
- outputs: `output$f`

`input$a` and `input$b` are used to create `c()`, which is combined with `input$d` to create `e()`. The output of the application is `e()`, which depends on all inputs and reactives to be generated.

:::question
```{r, eval=FALSE}
server2 <- function(input, output, session) {
  x <- reactive(input$x1 + input$x2 + input$x3)
  y <- reactive(input$y1 + input$y2)
  output$z <- renderText(x() / y())
}
```
:::

- inputs: `input$y1`, `input$y2`, `input$x1`, `input$x2`, `input$x3`
- reactives: `y()` and `x`
- outputs: `output$z`

Shiny inputs `y1` and `y2` are needed to create the reactive `y()` and the inputs `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are needed to create the reactive `x()`. There is a singular output which is reliant on both `x()` and `y()` but a change to one of the `x` inputs will trigger the need to recalculate `y()` and vice versa.

:::question
```{r, eval=FALSE}
server3 <- function(input, output, session) {
  d <- reactive(c() ^ input$d)
  a <- reactive(input$a * 10)
  c <- reactive(b() / input$c) 
  b <- reactive(a() + input$b)
}
```
:::

- inputs: `input$a`, `input$b`, `input$c`, `input$d`
- reactives: `a()`, `b()`, `c()`, `d()`

This is a hierarchical dependency tree where `a()` is only reliant on `input$a`, but `b()` is reliant on both `a()` and `input$b`. This cascade continues to `d()` which will be recalculated when there is any change to `a()`, `b()`, `c()`, or `d()`.

:::question
Can the reactive graph contain a cycle? Why/why not?
:::

No! This will create circular references and a recursion loop!

## 4.4.6.1 {-}

:::question
Use reactive expressions to reduce the duplicated code in the following simple apps.
