# 11.3.1 {-}

:::question
Generate app for visualising the results of [noise::ambient_simplex()](https://ambient.data-imaginist.com/reference/noise_simplex.html). Your app should allow the user to control the frequency, fractal, lacunarity, and gain, and be bookmarkable. How can you ensure the image looks exactly the same when reloaded from the bookmark? (Think about what the seed argument implies).

## 11.3.2 {-}

:::question
Make a simple app that lets you upload a csv file and then bookmark it. Upload a few files and then look in shiny_bookmarks. How do the files correspond to the bookmarkds? (Hint: you can use readRDS() to look inside the cache files that Shiny is generating).
